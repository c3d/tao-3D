# Tao3D error message filters
#
# Add one description line for each message you do not want to see reported
# as an error by Tao3D.
#
# Each line is a regular expression that Tao will apply to each error/warning
# message before it reaches the error window. As soon as one regular expression
# is found to match, the message is discarded.
# The RE syntax is the one used by QRegExp
# (http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qregexp.html#details).
# Empty lines are ignored. The comment character is # in first position.
# To write a regular expression that starts with #, simply prepend a backslash,
# like this: \#
# This file should be encoded as UTF-8, EOL = 0x0A.
#
# The default location of this file is Tao Presentation's installation
# directory. You may add additional regular expressions by creating
# a file called error_filters.txt in the Tao preference folder of your
# user account:
# - Windows: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Taodyne\Tao3D
# - MacOSX:  $HOME/Library/Application Support/Taodyne/Tao3D
# - Linux:   $HOME/.local/share/data/Taodyne/Tao3D
# (replace 'Tao3D' with 'Tao Presentations Player' if you are
# using the Player Edition).
